| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [mark](./mark)         | This is our primary logo, used to represent Randorm on all kinds of surfaces: in our products, at events, in email communications, or in help documentation.                                                                                                     | `svg`, `png` |
| [wordmark](./wordmark) | The wordmark is used in contexts where the audience may not be familiar with Randorm. It has a capitalized "Р" (for Russian) and "R" (for English). When referring to Randorm, whether the product, company, or service, keep it simple: "Рандорм" or "Randorm". | `svg`, `png` |
| [lockup](./lockup)     | This lockup combines the mark and wordmark and is used in scenarios where a new audience is introduced to the association between our primary logo and wordmark.                                                                                                 | `svg`, `png` |

   product name or logo.

Please don’t do these things:

   are Randorm, your offering or project is by Randorm, or that Randorm is

   business/organization, offering, project, domain name, social media account,

represent you or your projects, products, or company.
